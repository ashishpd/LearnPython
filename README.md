# LearnPython

A collection of small, commented Python examples for learning key concepts, progressing from basics to advanced topics.

## Structure

- **Lesson Files** (01-28): Python learning files with progressive complexity
  - `01_hello_world.py` through `28_exception_types.py`
  - Each file is self-contained with detailed comments and examples
  
- **`video_production/`**: Tools for generating educational videos from lesson files
  - See `video_production/README.md` for details

## Learning Path

See `LEARNING_PATH.md` for the complete learning progression.
